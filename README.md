# Gig Crunch

** CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION  **

## What does it do?

Gig Crunch is a gig tracker app that allows musicians to enter gigs they have played and provides a dashboard that breakdowns those gigs. I am in the initial stages of building this and will be working on features incrementally. The main goal of this project is to create something that I thought I would use (being a drummer) and that would allow me to improve my skils with React, .NET Core, and Redux.

This idea came from a vanilla JS project I created earlier in 2020. I wanted to scale it out and add more features, and thought this would be a great opportunity to learn some new skills as well.

I will be using this readme as a journal/notetaker as I make progress.

## TO DO

1. ~~Create basic JSON API~~
1. ~~Create basic React App~~
1. ~~Update React App to consume JSON API~~
1. ~~Add basic UI (styles)~~
1. ~~Add all existing functionality that was in the vanilla JS version~~
1. ~~Create Web API and CRUD routes using Entity Framework~~
1. ~~Test React App and make sure data is still flowing through API to app~~
1. Add Redux - create store and actions
1. Add routing
1. Create view to add gigs
1. Create view to add bands

## Future TO DO

1. Add Auth/Sign In
2. Add Users to DB
3. Update UI and using something similar to Victory Charts
